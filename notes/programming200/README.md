# Chapter 0x200. PROGRAMMING

>Hacker is a term for both those who write code and those who exploit it. Even though these two groups of hackers have different end goals, both groups use similar problem-solving techniques. Since an understanding of programming helps those who exploit, and an understanding of exploitation helps those who program, many hackers do both.

## What is programming?

## Pseudo-code

> English arranged with a general structure similar to a high-level language. ... It's sort of the nebulous missing link between English and high-level programming languages like C.

## Control Structures

> Without control structures, a program would just be a series of instructions executed in sequential order. ... they change the flow of the program's execution from a simple sequential order to a more complex and more useful flow.

### if-then-else

```c
if (condition) then // implied and therefore left out
{ 
    //instructions to execute if the condition is met
} else {
    // instructions to execute if the condition is NOT met
}
```

### while/until loops



### for loops

>This is generally used when a programmer wants to loop for a certain number of iterations.


## more fundamental programming concepts

### variables

>A variable can simply be thought of as an object that holds data that can be changedâ€” hence the name.

### arithmetic operations
